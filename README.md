# Ride Share Data Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to compare the total weekly fares for urban, suburban and rural city types. With this information, adjustments can be made to the business strategy to maximize profitability.

## Results

The data was collected for each city type and compiled into a single summary chart. This allows for a comparison among cities. The table of data can be seen below:

With this information, we can determine that urban city types see the most rides with suburban second, followed by the rural city type. A similar trend can be seen with the number of drivers. Urban city types have the largest number of drivers and rural the least.

Where the trend differs is in the average fare per ride and the average fare per driver. Here, rural city types have the highest average fare per ride and fare per drive. This is likely due to further distances being traveled.

A line chart was produced that details the total fares by city type over a period of time. See the chart below:

 There are similar trends between the three city types. Each sees reduced fares in the early months of the year with a gradual increase until March where there is a spike. Urban city types see a more constistant fare over the period of time while suburban and rural areas dip after March. The suburban city type however, sees a large spike just after April.

## Summary

With this information we can make a few recommendations. They are as follows:

    - Increase marketing for rural areas in between March and April. The rural average fares are much higher and would result in an significant increase in total fares for that type
    - Urban city types have 50% more drivers than total rides. Reduce the total number of drivers to be more efficient.
    -  Increase markerting during the early months before March for suburban and urban city types. This will bring in more rides and increase total fares collected
